What You'll Be Building
All right! Now that you know how to control the level of privacy in a Ruby class, we can use that to our advantage when creating objects. 
In this case, we’ll be making an Account object with public methods to display balances and transfer funds, 
but which rely on private methods to make sure the user’s PIN (personal identification number) is correct before approving transactions.

Note: We’re just using banking as an example because it’s a nice real-world analogy. This isn’t for real banking, so don’t use any real banking information!

  attr_reader :name, :balance

  end
  
  def display_balance(pin_number)
    puts pin_number == pin ? "Balance: $#{@balance}." : pin_error
  end
  
  def withdraw(pin_number, amount)
    if pin_number == pin
      @balance -= amount
      puts "Withdrew #{amount}. New balance: $#{@balance}."
    else
      puts pin_error
    end
  end

my_account.display_balance(1234)
